# Cilium Gateway for LLM services
#
# NOTE: We use the shared hello-gateway in hello-world namespace
# which already has the *.stigen.home wildcard certificate and IP.
# The HTTPRoute in httproutes.yaml attaches to that gateway.
#
# If you need a separate gateway, uncomment the below and ensure
# Cilium LB IPAM has IPs available. You'll also need to update
# the parentRefs in httproutes.yaml.
